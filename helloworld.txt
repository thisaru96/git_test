This is second commit test

1) Git status - check for unsaved changes first
2) First make the changes 
3) Save File
4) git add . - add to the waiting Room (if there was only changes to one file, specify that eg: git add helloworld.txt)
5) git commit -m "This is where you place the comment for the change"
6) git log - to check if the changes are logged
6) git push - to push to github repo
